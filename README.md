# Weekly Challenge #9 - Dragon Ball

**For this challenge, you need to implement a program that takes a position on Earth and find 6 other points on land that are the farthest away from each others.** In order to honor the memory of Akira Toriyama who created Dragon Ball, the idea of this week's challenge is to figure out how to hide the Dragon Balls on Earth so that they are the hardest to find!

### Winners:

* In first place, @mhelvens wins $75 with "Dragonball Evolution". The dragonballs hovering over the earth makes me want to take a cloud and go collect them! https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-9-dragon-ball/issues/3

* In second place, @breytenlybaert wins $50 with "Projections & Tracking". I never realized that there were so many ways to project the earth on a 2d screen. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-9-dragon-ball/issues/2

* In third place, @evgenyvinnik wins $25 with "Placement Tool". I really like the manual aspect of the process where you have to click to optimize the placement. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-9-dragon-ball/issues/1

* Even though it missed the deadline, @kevinjzhang and @seanyang0813 used importance sampling with Von Mises-Fisher distribution to place the balls which is really interesting. https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-9-dragon-ball/issues/4
